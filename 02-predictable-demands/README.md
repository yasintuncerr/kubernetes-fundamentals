# 📌 Kubernetes Patterns: Predictable Demands Examples

This repository contains hands-on examples illustrating the **Predictable Demands** pattern, as detailed in Chapter 2 of the *Kubernetes Patterns* book. This pattern focuses on helping Kubernetes make better scheduling decisions by explicitly declaring the resource and runtime needs of applications. The main topics covered in this chapter include:

- Runtime Dependencies
- Resource Profiles
- Pod Priority
- Project Resources & Capacity Planning
