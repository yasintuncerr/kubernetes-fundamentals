# **``Kubernetes`` Patterns: A Practical Study Guide**
This repository aims to provide a practical understanding of cloud-native application design on Kubernetes through concrete, hands-on implementations of key architectural and operational patterns. It is structured as a technical learning resource, offering real-world YAML manifests and examples that demonstrate how these patterns are applied in modern Kubernetes-based systems.

The examples and concepts presented here are based on and inspired by the work of Ibryam and HuÃŸ (2022), who categorized and explained common Kubernetes design patterns in their comprehensive guide.
